we can use different products to complete te task.

1. The right product which can make a HTTP request to: https://dummyjson.com/products
can be : IPWorks
		 IPWorks SSL 
		 SSIS Components

3.The right product which can parse JSON data can be :  IPWorks
														IPWorks MQ

For question 2 and 4 I have used IPWorks product and .NET platform.
